# Task 1: Smart Nature Observer

## Objective
Create a prototype video analytics system for natural environments that can detect and label both static (e.g., mountains, trees) and dynamic objects (e.g., animals, birds). The system should provide an intuitive interface for reviewing and refining AI-generated segmentations through a modern, responsive canvas tool.
