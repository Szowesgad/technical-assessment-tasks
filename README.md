Technical Assessment Tasks
This repository contains two technical assessment tasks focusing on rapid prototyping and agentic coding skills. The tasks are designed to evaluate your approach to problem-solving and ability to quickly create functional prototypes.

üéØ Key Points

Focus on Rapid Prototyping: These tasks are NOT about building production-ready features. We want to see your approach to quick, efficient problem-solving.
Time Expectation: 3-4 hours total
Evaluation Priority: Problem-solving approach > Code completeness
Tool Freedom: Use any libraries/tools you prefer - the end result matters most
üí° What We're Looking For

Smart Trade-offs:

Choose what to implement vs what to mock
Focus on core functionality over perfect code
Document your decisions
Technical Skills:

Basic implementation of key features
Clean, readable code structure
Understanding of performance considerations
Problem Solving:

How you approach complex requirements
Which shortcuts you take (and why)
How you document your thought process
üöÄ Tasks Overview

Smart Nature Observer

Video processing prototype
Real-time analysis simulation
Basic UI for interaction
Smart Voice Notes Organizer

Audio processing prototype
Text analysis simulation
Simple organization interface
üìù Getting Started

Choose Your Focus:

Pick the most interesting aspects to implement
Mock or simulate complex features
Document what you would do with more time
Quick Setup:

Fork this repository
Use provided example code as starting point
Start with basic functionality
Submission:

Working prototype (even if limited in scope)
Documentation of your approach
Notes about trade-offs made
‚ö° Example Approach

A good prototype might include:

Basic UI skeleton
Simulated ML processing
One or two core features working
Clear documentation of what's mocked/simulated
Notes about how you'd expand it in production
‚ùì Questions?

Open an issue for technical questions

We're happy to discuss your approach!
üéì Evaluation Criteria

We value:

Clean, maintainable code
Smart architectural decisions
Clear documentation of trade-offs
Working prototype (even if limited)
We don't expect:

Production-ready code
Full feature implementation
Perfect error handling
Complete test coverage
